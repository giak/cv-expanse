## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Project Overview

CV Generator is a modern web application designed to help users create, edit, and export professional CVs using the open-source JSON Resume standard format. It provides an intuitive interface for managing CV data with multilingual support, real-time validation, and export capabilities in multiple formats.

Key features include:

- Interactive form-based editing of all JSON Resume schema sections
- Offline-first architecture with localStorage persistence
- Export in multiple formats (JSON, HTML, PDF)
- Real-time validation and ATS optimization guidance
- Multilingual support (English and French)

## 2. Problem Statement

### 2.1 Current Challenges

Despite the prevalence of digital tools for CV creation, several challenges persist in the current landscape:

1. **Format Fragmentation**: Most CV builders use proprietary formats, creating vendor lock-in and limiting data portability.

2. **Privacy and Data Ownership Concerns**: Many online CV builders require account creation and store user data on their servers, raising privacy concerns and creating dependency on third-party services.

3. **Internet Dependency**: Most modern CV builders require a constant internet connection, limiting accessibility in offline environments.

4. **Limited Technical Standards Adoption**: The JSON Resume standard provides a structured data format for CVs, but has limited tooling for non-technical users who could benefit from its standardization.

5. **Internationalization Gaps**: Many CV tools lack robust multilingual support, creating barriers for international users or those targeting global job markets.

6. **ATS Compatibility Issues**: Many user-created CVs fail to pass through Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) effectively, reducing applicants' chances of securing interviews.

7. **Export Limitations**: CV tools often limit export capabilities to premium tiers or provide limited format options.

### 2.2 Opportunities

These challenges present several opportunities for the CV Generator project:

1. **Open Standard Adoption**: Promote and expand adoption of the JSON Resume standard by providing accessible tooling.

2. **User Data Control**: Empower users with complete control over their CV data through an offline-first approach.

3. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Develop a web-based tool that works across devices and browsers without requiring installation.

4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Create an intuitive, step-by-step interface that guides users through the CV creation process with real-time feedback.

5. **Multilingual Reach**: Support multiple languages in both the interface and content, expanding accessibility to international users.

6. **ATS Optimization**: Provide guidance and validation to ensure CVs created with the tool are ATS-friendly.

7. **Modern Architecture Showcase**: Demonstrate the benefits of Clean Architecture, TypeScript, and modern frontend practices in a real-world application.

### 6.3 Data Management

#### Data Model

The core data structure follows the JSON Resume schema, with extensions for application-specific needs.

**Primary Entities**:

1. **Resume**: The core domain entity representing a complete CV

   - Contains all sections defined in the JSON Resume schema
   - Includes metadata for application-specific features

2. **Basics**: Personal information section

   - Contains name, email, location, profiles, etc.
   - Implements validation for required fields

3. **Work Experience**: Professional history entries

   - Includes company, position, duration, achievements
   - Supports chronological ordering and date validation

4. **Education**: Educational background

   - Contains institutions, degrees, courses, durations
   - Implements date range and required field validation

5. **Skills**: Professional capabilities

   - Includes skill name, proficiency level, keywords
   - Supports categorization and priority ordering

6. **Projects**: Personal or professional projects
   - Contains project details, links, technologies
   - Supports date ranges and highlights

**Value Objects**:

The application uses value objects to encapsulate domain concepts:

1. **Email**: Validates and formats email addresses
2. **DateRange**: Manages start and end dates with validation
3. **URL**: Validates and normalizes URLs
4. **PhoneNumber**: Formats and validates phone numbers
5. **MarkdownText**: Handles text with markdown formatting

#### Persistence Strategy

The application uses a client-side only persistence strategy:

1. **Primary Storage**: Browser's localStorage API

   - CV data serialized to JSON and stored in localStorage
   - Automatic saving on changes with debouncing
   - Version tracking for schema migrations

2. **Storage Optimization**:

   - Data compression for large CVs
   - Chunking for CVs approaching localStorage limits
   - Storage usage monitoring with warnings

3. **Import/Export**:
   - Import from standard JSON Resume files
   - Export to JSON, HTML, and PDF formats
   - Backup/restore functionality for data portability
